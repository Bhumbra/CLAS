Completed: 
- template code for following array products:  ewise (entrywise), outer, inner, and mmdot.
- SSE4 assembly SIMD instructions for fast single-threaded double-precision matrix products (mmdot).
- C++-class based objects implementing std::thread constructs to multi-threaded matrix products (mmdot).
- The same for simpler products i.e. ewise_product, inner-product, and outer_product.
